    <h1> All about Nkengie </h1>
 
<p>  I chose Babson because of the posse program. which is a Full tuition 
    Scholarship program that I was able to get into. Due to my scholarship 
    I am able to go to on eof the best Business colleges in the country.
    Since I am a Senior here at Babson it is my last year and I have been 
    thinking about all I want to do. I am concentrating in Business analytics and IT 
    management. I hope to be invovlved in Analytics and Data Science later on in my Career.
    This is partially the reason I have been teaching myself code on the side in addition
    to my Babson course load.

<p> My favorite Sport is track and field. I think I have an additonal appreciation 
    for the sport because I ran for 4 years in High school but never for Babson.
    It was such a great experiecne the adrenaline and excitement you feel at the finish
    line is like no other and I loved every second of it. A close seocnd would have to be
    Soccer or futbol and my favorite team is Liverpool.
